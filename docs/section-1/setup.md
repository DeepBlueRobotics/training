In order to write and run robot code, we need to install a few pieces of software.

## WPILib

The WPILib suite installs the IDE we write our code in and the tools needed to run and deploy that code to the robot.

Follow the instructions on [the official WPILib documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html) for your respective OS.

## Git and Github

We use Git and Github to keep track of and collaborate on code.

Again, follow the instructions for your respective OS to [get Git here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

If you do not have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, create one now.

Once you have your account, tell a programming mentor or programming lead your username so they can add you to our GitHub organization.

Next, set up your username (your real name) and email in Git by following these instructions: 

- [Setting your username](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-your-username-in-git)
- [Setting your email address](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address)
