We have significant overlap with SenAc training so let's just quickly go through [their Electronics presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y2GSd2B3aV2_6J5xKNS-_xWRiGW_daArdgr4zasUuno/edit#slide=id.g253cb92c37_0_37).

Key takeaways:

- The RoboRIO is the "brain" of the robot and runs our robot code.
- The radio is what we use to communicate between the robot and the driver station computer. 
- Motor controllers control the motors and communicate with the RoboRIO.
- The PDP gives power to the motor controllers.
