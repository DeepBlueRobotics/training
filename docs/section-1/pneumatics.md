Similar to elex, SenAct also has [a pneumatics presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UDH-Om2QCeOL6JKvXSvE9Xdm5i8acvCqRSJa4wcBMAM/edit#slide=id.g2573de0a58_0_73). Take some time to read through it.

Key takeaways:

- Air is pumped from the compressor into the air tanks which then feed the air to the solenoids.
- Storage tank air pressure should be around 120 PSI, while working pressure should not exceed 60 PSI. There are two guages on the robot indicating the two levels of pressure.
- Pistons and other pneumatic devices are controlled by the solenoids, which open and close values to let air through based on RoboRIO input.
