So you know how to write Java code, and you know the basics of how our robot code is written. Now, you might be wondering, how do we collaborate and write code as a team? Surely, we don't take turns passing around a computer to type in our lines. Enter version control. 

[Here's a handy article about it](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/). Stop at the steps, you don't need to do them.

Once you're done, we'll do some exercises to see if you've got it.

!!! note
    We'll be using [VS Code's built-in version control tools in this tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol), but there are many other good tools too, including [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client), and of course, the ol' command line. You don't need to know how to use the command line for FRC, but it's a useful, if not essential, skill if you want to go beyond.

## Practice
VS Code is the text editor we will be using to write and run our code, and should have been installed with the WPILib suite during setup. Open up VS Code and follow the "Cloning a repository" section of [the VS Code git tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_cloning-a-repository) to clone [this repo](https://github.com/DeepBlueRobotics/training/).

!!! note 
    If you look at the tutorial above, they mention the "Git: Clone" command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P). However, it's good practice to use "Git: Clone(Recursive)" instead of just "Git(Clone)" because cloning the repo recursively also clones all the defined submodules in the repo as well.

Navigate to this file in the repo (`docs/section-2/version-control.md`) and add your name to the list below.

Now stage and commit your changes with the message `add [your name]`, and then push your changes. Refer to the [Git tutorial](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) and [VS Code tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol) if needed.


!!! tip
    By convention, commit names are in simple present tense. Things like `add name` or `fix these bugs` or `update readme`. You are expected to write descriptive commit messages that follow this convention.
