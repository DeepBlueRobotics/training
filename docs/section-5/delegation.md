## Shadowing Team Members
Programming team members who are not fully ready to work independently during build season will be assigned to shadow a more experienced member. Experienced members who are assigned a shadow should be explaining and talking about their code while they are writing it, and should try to involve the shadow in as much as they can.

## Build Season Schedule
> Get

> -B

The programming team's goal is to have at least basic functionality code ready to test on mechanisms as soon as we have mechanisms done. Approximately, that means the drivetrain code should be written by the end of the first week, and code for all other mechanisms written by the end of week 4. 

Team members from each subteam will be distributed to each of the mechanisms during the start of build season. You are generally responsible for writing the code for the mechanism group you are part of.
