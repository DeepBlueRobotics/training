## Trello

We will use Trello for task delegation. Please read through [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E6NWQwGugOpqZyM3Rbugq30OSHSfIXFvhhhAqgV1Mbk/edit#slide=id.g255a686be2_0_25) starting from the page that says "Project Management with Trello", and then fill out the form on the last page to get onto the team Trello.

More about how the programming team uses Trello:

- The programming lead sorts the cards in the "Todo" list by priority, but anyone is welcome to add cards to the bottom of the list.
- The programming lead will assign tasks to team members. If you have not been assigned a task, you can choose the highest card on the "Todo" list that you can do.
- Assign yourself to a card when you start it, and move it to the "In Progress" column. When you are done, move it to the "Done" column and notify a programming lead or mentor to check you off and archive the card.
- Please update your card before you leave every day, including changing the description, moving it, checking off parts of a checkbox, or adding comments on your progress onto the card

## Shadowing Team Members
Programming team members who are not fully ready to work independently during build season will be assigned to shadow a more experienced member. Experienced members who are assigned a shadow should be explaining and talking about their code while they are writing it, and should try to involve the shadow in as much as they can.

## Build Season Schedule
> Gotta go fast!

>  -Sanik Hedgehog

The programming team's goal is to have at least basic functionality code ready to test on mechanisms as soon as we have mechanisms done. Approximately, that means the drivetrain code should be written by the end of the first week, and code for all other mechanisms written by the end of week 4. 

Team members from each subteam will be distributed to each of the mechanisms during the start of build season. You are generally responsible for writing the code for the mechanism group you are part of.
