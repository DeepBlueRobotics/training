These are things that should be checked/changed in the curriculum before pre-season starts every year.

- All the links work and direct to the correct places
- The instructions that are about WPILib are up-to-date and match the new library changes for the year
    - That means updating, testing, and possibly rewriting the robot code in the `code/` directory
- The instructions in section 5 "Build Season Process" are up to date. This and WPILib are the most prone to change
- Nothing was accidentally changed in the master branch by trainees
    - In the branches they created, the only change should be adding their name to `section-2/version-control.md`
- The branches that were created by trainees for their version control practice are deleted
- New items are added to this list based on what we missed this year
- The curriculum is adjusted on difficulty and odd parts are fixed based on trainee input
- Quickly look through the entire site to make sure everything is correct
- Make sure whoever is presenting the presentations in section 1 are familiar with them
    - You can coordinate with SenAct on maybe giving the presentation together or having a SenAct team member do the presentation
- We have the newest and most relevant XKCDs \ (•◡•) /
