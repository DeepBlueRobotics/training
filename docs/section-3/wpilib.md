## JavaDocs

Java has a standard documentation format that is autogenerated from documentation comments in the code. We will be referening them extensively to write our code. 

On top of a JavaDoc contains a description of the class, its package, what it inherits, and more. Below that is a section containing the class's constructors, and the section below contains the methods you can call from that class. If you click on any of the constructors or methods, you get directed to a section with more details about what you clicked. [Here's an example of a JavaDoc of a class you should be faimilar with: ArrayList](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html).

## WPILib

WPILib is the name of the library FRC provides us to control the robot with. Its JavaDocs are located here: <https://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/index.html>. We will be mostly using the library's edu.wpi.first.wpilibj package, and you can search for a class or method using the search bar located on the top right corner of your screen.

## Deploying robot code

!!! warning "Before you start"
    This part needs:

    - a practice electronics board that has a Talon SRX
    - a computer with driver station software installed
    - a controller connected to the computer  
    - a brushed motor

You should have already cloned this repo in the last section. Open up the `TrainingRobot` project inside the `code/` directory of this repo. Now connect to the RoboRIO of the practice board with a USB cable, click on the WPILib logo on the top right of VSCode which looks like this: ![wpilib](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/19267233?s=400&v=4){: style="height:25px;width:25px"}, and then choose "Deploy Robot Code". It should take a minute to deploy the code before displaying "Build Successful" in green. 

Once you have that, connect a driver station computer to the RoboRIO and a motor to the Talon, enable, and press the X key on the controller. If the motor runs, then you're all set!

## Using WPILib

You may have noticed that the motor only runs for one brief second. Let's change the code so that it runs as long as you press the button.

In the `TrainingRobot` project, find the `OI.java` file (`src/main/java/frc/robot/OI.java`). Currently, the `whenPressed()` method of `runMotorButton` is pressed. Refer to the WPILib JavaDocs to determine what you need to change `whenPressed()` to in order to run the command continuously. (Hint: `runMotorButton` is an instance of the `JoystickButton` class.)

Once you think you figured it out, follow the above "Deploying robot code" section again to deploy, and see if your code worked!
