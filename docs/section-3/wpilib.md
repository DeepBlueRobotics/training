## JavaDocs

Java has a standard documentation format that is autogenerated from documentation comments in the code. We will be referencing them extensively to write our code. 

On top of a JavaDoc contains a description of the class, its package, what it inherits, and more. Below that is a section containing the class' constructors, and the section below contains the methods you can call from that class. If you click on any of the constructors or methods, you get directed to a section with more details about what you clicked. [Here's a JavaDoc of a class you should be familiar with: ArrayList](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html).

## WPILib

WPILib is the name of the library FRC provides us to control the robot with. [Its JavaDocs are located here](https://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/index.html) (and you can also find a link to them in the [Resources](/resources/) page of this site). We will be mostly using the library's `edu.wpi.first.wpilibj` package, and you can search for a class or method using the search bar located on the top right corner of your screen.

## Deploying robot code

!!! warning "Before you start"
    This part needs:

    - a practice electronics board that has a Talon SRX
    - a computer with driver station software installed
    - a controller connected to the computer  
    - a brushed motor

Clone the [`TrainingRobot`](https://github.com/DeepBlueRobotics/TrainingRobot) repo. Now connect to the RoboRIO of the practice board with a USB cable, click on the WPILib logo on the top right of VSCode which looks like this: ![wpilib](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/19267233?s=400&v=4){: style="height:25px;width:25px"}, and then choose "Deploy Robot Code". It should take a minute to deploy the code before displaying "Build Successful" in green. 

!!! note
    Deploying code to the RoboRIO only works on a Windows computer; however, you can still build your code to see if it compiles correctly before moving onto a Windows computer to complete this part.

Once you have that, connect a driver station computer to the RoboRIO and a motor to the Talon, enable, and press the X key on the controller. If the motor runs, then you're all set!

## Using WPILib

You may have noticed that the motor does not stop running when you release the button. Let's change the code so that it runs as long as you press the button.

**Step 1: Change the button to trigger the command continuously while it's held rather than once when it's pressed**

In the `TrainingRobot` project, find the `RobotContainer.java` file (`src/main/java/org/team199/trainingrobot/RobotContainer.java`). Currently, line 20 contains the method `whenHeld()`. Refer to the WPILib JavaDocs to determine what you need to change `whenHeld()` to in order to run the command while the button is pressed. (Hint: `runMotorButton` is an instance of the `JoystickButton` class.)

**Step 2: Stop the motors when the command ends**

In the same project, you'll find the `RunMotor.java` file in the `commands` directory. In the `RunMotor` class, the `end()` method is currently empty. Add code to it that stops the motors. (Hint: you might want to write something similar to what's in `execute()`.)

**Step 3: Deploy!**

Once you think you figured it out, follow the above "Deploying robot code" section again to deploy, and see if your code worked!
