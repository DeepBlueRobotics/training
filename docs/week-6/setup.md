It's that time of year again. Time to install software. Let's just get on with it.

## VSCode
You should already have VSCode installed, but FRC uses a slightly modified version that includes the extensions and scripts that are needed to write and run robot code. [Follow the instructions here to install it.](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/1027503-installing-c-and-java-development-tools-for-frc)

## Github
If you don't have a Github account already, create one at <https://github.com/>. We use Github to share and collaborate on code. 

Once you have a Github account, post it on the programming channel on Mattermost so that we can add you to the team's Github organization.

## Git
The final thing you need is Git. While Github is a website where we store code, Git is the actual software, run locally on your computer, used for collaboration between developers. They are not the same thing, and Github uses Git.
