In order to write and run robot code, we need to install a few pieces of software.

## WPILib

The WPILib suite installs the IDE we write our code in and the tools needed to run and deploy that code to the robot.

Follow the instructions on this page for your respective OS: <https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/getting_started/l/999999-installing-c-and-java-development-tools-for-frc>

## Git and Github

We use Git and Github to keep track of and collaborate on code.

Get Git here, and again, follow the instructions for your respective OS: <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>

If you do not have a Github account, create one now: <https://github.com>. 

Once you have your account, tell a programming mentor or programming lead your username so they can add you to our Github organization.
