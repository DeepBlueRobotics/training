Let's look at how our robot code project is structured.

!!! note
    We'll be assuming that our robot code package is `frc199.robot` and our code lives in `src/main/java/frc199/robot` but honestly the package naming scheme varies by year and by team, and it doesn't matter as long as you keep it consistent for a project.

A robot project structure generally looks something like this:
```
src/main/java/org/team199/
  └── robot2019/
  |   |   Main.java
  |   |   Robot.java
  |   |   RobotMap.java
  |   |   OI.java
  |   |
  |   └── subsystems/
  |   |   |   Drivetrain.java
  |   |   |   Intake.java
  |   |   |   Climber.java
  |   |   |   Lift.java
  |   |
  |   └── commands/
  |       |   Drive.java
  |       |   Climb.java
  |       |   RunIntake.java
  |       |   RunEject.java
  |       |   MoveLift.java
  |       |   Autonomous.java
  |
  └── lib/
      |   Characterization.java
      |   OtherFancyMathStuff.java
```
It's a lot, so let's break it down. This is an intro to our robot structure, so we won't go into specifics on how to actually write the code until the next section.

## Main.java
This file is autogenerated, and there is rarely any reason to touch this file at all. It contains the classic `main` method, which is run at startup and starts up the rest of the robot code.  It is autogenerated, and we rarely touch it at all.

## Robot.java
This file is the control center of the robot. It initializes and contains the Objects for all the subsystems, and has the methods that are called to run the robot.

## RobotMap.java
This is where we create and store the objects for the motor controllers and solenoids that are used in the subsystems. Its primary use is to map the port numbers on the PDP, CAN bus, and solenoid(s) to specific Objects in the code. 

## OI.java
OI stands for Operator Interface. Like that makes its function any clearer. 

The OI class is similar to RobotMap, but instead of connecting motor and solenoid ports to their Objects in the code, it connects joystick/controller buttons to commands and functionality in the code. 

## Subsystems
Subsystems are anoter name for robot mechanisms, such as a drivetrain, an elevator, an intake, or a climber. The subystem classes contain the Objects for the motor controllers and solenoids that are taken from `RobotMap` and have methods for controlling the subsystem, which are used by commands.

## Commands
Commands are what run the robot. For example, there may be a `RunIntake` command that runs two motors to the wheels that intake a game piece. 

## Lib
The `lib` folder is where we would store the complex calculations, wrappers, or other things that do not directly interact with the robot, but are rather called on by commands or subsystems to assist in their execution. Stuff in this folder would be valuable code that we would actually want to keep and develop on from one year to another, such as drivetrain characterization, motion profiling, or swerve drive code.
