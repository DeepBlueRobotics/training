So you know how to write Java code, and you know the basics of how our robot code is written. Now, you might be wondering, how do we collaborate and write code as a team? Surely, we don't take turns passing around a computer to type in our lines. Enter version control. 

Here's a handy article about it, read up to "The Github flow" (you don't need to learn about the command line): <https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/>. 

Once you're done, we'll do some exercises to see if you've got it.

!!! note
    We'll be using [VS Code's built-in version control tools in this tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol), but there are many other good tools too, including [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client), and of course, the ol' command line. You don't need to know how to use the command line for FRC, but it's a useful, if not essential, skill if you want to go beyond.

## Practice
VS Code is the text editor we will be using to write and run our code, and should have been installed with the WPILib suite during setup. Open up VS Code and follow [the VS Code git tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol) clone this repo: <https://github.com/DeepBlueRobotics/training/>

Navigate to this file in the repo (`docs/section-2/version-control.md`) and add your name to the list below.

    Kevin Wang,
    Adam Kalayjian,
    Alice Chamberlin,
    Ryan DeBarger,
    Jonathan Shi,
    James DiMartino,
    Vernon Luk,
    Ethan Htun,
    Kevin Bachelor,
    Megan Li

Now stage and commit your changes with the message `add [your name]`, and then push your changes. Refer to the [Git tutorial](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) and [VS Code tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol) if needed.
