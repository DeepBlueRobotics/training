## Before you start coding

Before you code the drivetrain, you need to find the answers to these questions:

- How many motors will there be on each side?
- What motor controllers are we using the control the drivetrain?
- What ports are we plugging the motor controllers into?

Once you know the answers to these, you should be ready to get started.

## Getting started

You can use the `TrainingRobot` project in this repo that you've been using in previous sections as a base for your drivetrain code.

Goals for this project:

1. be able to drive the drivetrain with the joysticks in arcade mode (search that up if you don't know)
2. be able to drive the drivetrain with the joysticks in tank mode
3. have the drivetrain move forward then spin around for the remainder of the time during the autonomous period

Alright, get to it! Use the resources listed in the "Resources" section, past robot code, and help from mentors and programming team members to your full advantage!
