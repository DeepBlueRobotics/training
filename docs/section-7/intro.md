What's covered in this section:

- Common Sensors

- PID Control

- Drivetrain Characterization

- Autonomous

- And so much more!

Make sure that you understand all that is discussed in sections 1 - 6, as section 7 relies on familiarity with Java and the WPILib API (plus a bit of math/physics).

Are you ready?
