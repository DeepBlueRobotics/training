For those who want to go above and beyond, here is an assortment of topics of varying degrees of difficulty that don't fit in the other sections, either because some sections were too long or because it didn't fit with the theme of the other topics.

## State Space Control

## Computer Vision
In every FRC game in recent memory, there are strips of retroreflective tapes paced in strategic places on the field. We can use vision to track these strips of tape and effectively calculate where we are relative to them. This helps with accuracy during an autonomous mode or auto-alignment code.

We have cameras, green light rings, Raspberry Pis, a Jetson TX1, and even a Limelight for us to play with and use for vision processing. I recommend starting with the Limelight because it requires significantly less setup and tweaking to get started with but isn't necessarily less powerful.

## LEDs
Controlling LEDs on our robot isn't very difficult, however, it makes our robot looks cool. Who doesn't want that? Besides, LEDs also serve practical uses by showing the drive team what state the robot is in via its colors. 

We have a small stash of RGB LEDs, along with an Arduino if that is needed. Make our robot look beautiful!
