You now have everything you need to create an efficient autonomous routine! Here's your challenge:

**Task**: Implement a fully-functional autnomous routine that follows a pre-compiled path and aligns to a vision target. Your autonomous routine must use PID, Drivetrain Characterization, Pathweaver, and Limelight.

It is highly recommended that you test your code using Unit Tests, either through JUnit or Mockito.
