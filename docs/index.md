# Welcome

Hi. Welcome to the programming training docs for Deep Blue Robotics.

Before you get started, let me just say this: We are moving at a significantly faster pace than any computer science course offered at the school, and it's okay to get stuck or not know something. The Programming team veterans are here to help, please ask us questions! This is pretty difficult stuff, but I guarantee that it will be worth it and that we'll make it through together.

Alright, let's get started.
