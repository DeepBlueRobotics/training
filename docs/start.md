## Setting up Java
If you do not have Java on your computer, please install Java 11 here: <https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html>

!!! note
    We will be using Java 11 for robot code, but if you already have Java installed, any version will do for now.

## Setting up Visual Studio Code
If you do not have VSCode on your computer, please install it here: <https://code.visualstudio.com/Download>

!!! note
    Visual Studio Code (aka VSCode) is not the same as Visual Studio. Make sure that you have VSCode and not Visual Studio.

We'll be using the Code Runner extension:

1. Once you finish installing VSCode, open the app and click on the extensions tab on the left side. (TODO: add image)
2. Search for "Code Runner" in the search bar and click **Install**.
3. You're now ready to start!
